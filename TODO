----
go back to independent sketch for each doodle.
create runner scripts which put .pde file in directory before running.

why? processing is designed around small sketches.
not huge programs with multiple files.
it is possible to grow sketches to multiple files but the
processing environment works against ist.
the editor does have tabs but it gets weird with more than a few.
all variables and functions are global.
need workaround (classes) to prevent namespace overflow.
need specially crafted starter code to tell processing
which doddle to run.

all in all it is cumbersome to put many doodles in one sketch.
so why not pull "cumbersome" out to shell script level
and let processing be happy with small sketches.
