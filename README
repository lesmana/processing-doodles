processing doodles of lesmana

mainly optical art

no interactive sketches

plan is to write script to generate looping video of each sketch
then upload to some gallery
then ???
PROFITT!!!1

the processing editor cannot supply command line arguments

to invoke with command line arguments use following

processing-java --sketch=doodles --run doodlename

there is a default doodle for when invokin from editor
