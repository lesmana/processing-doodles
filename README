looping optical art animations

helper shell scripts
--------------------

i like working on the command line.
some processing peculiarities makes this cumbersome.

processing is a bit finicky with
how it wants the sketch source files:
the sketch file must be located in a directory
with the same name as the file.

this makes renaming sketches particularly cumbersome.
one has to rename the directory and then rename the file.
creating new sketches also require two commands
(directory then file).

furthermore running the editor requires the sketch filename
but running the sketch standalone require the sketch dirname.

so i created a set of helper shell scripts
that i can run with either the dirname or filename
and the script will work out the correct name for the use case.

new.sh will create a sketch as processing wants it:
with matching directory and filename.
bonus: some minimal boilerplate code.

rename.sh will rename a sketch.
taking care of matching directory and filename.

edit.sh will open a sketch in the processing editor.

run.sh will run the sketch standalone (without the editor).

plan
----

write script to create video from sketch.

also add watermark

then upload videos somewhere like imgur.com

maybe upload code to some processing gallery like openprocessing.org
